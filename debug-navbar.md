# Navbar Fix Debug Guide

## What Was Fixed

1. **Removed duplicate Navbar**: Deleted `src/app/Navbar.tsx` which had its own auth state management
2. **Improved useAuth hook**: Added better debugging, prevented re-initialization, and fixed loading states
3. **Fixed AuthProvider**: Made sure context values match the expected interface
4. **Added hydration protection**: Navbar now shows a loading state until React hydrates to prevent mismatches

## The Core Issue

You had two Navbar components:
- `src/app/Navbar.tsx` - Had independent auth state (BAD)
- `src/components/Navbar.tsx` - Used centralized useAuth hook (GOOD)

The layout was using the good one, but conflicts could occur during development.

## Testing the Fix

1. **Load the page**: https://topcitytickets-owersjg7i-ray-starnes-projects.vercel.app
2. **Check initial load**: Should show loading placeholders briefly, then your actual auth state
3. **Refresh the page**: Navigation should NOT disappear
4. **Open browser dev tools**: Check console for `[useAuth]` logs to see auth flow

## Expected Console Output

```
🔍 [useAuth] Starting auth check...
📊 [useAuth] Session result: { hasSession: true, hasUser: true, userId: "your-id" }
🔍 [useAuth] Checking role for user: your-id
✅ [useAuth] Found RBAC role: admin
✅ [useAuth] Setting loading to false
🎯 [useAuth] Current state: { hasUser: true, userId: "your-id", email: "your-email", role: "admin", isAdmin: true, isSeller: true, loading: false }
```

## If Issues Persist

1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Try incognito mode
3. Check the browser console for any error messages
4. Verify you're logged in to the production site

The key changes ensure that:
- Only ONE source of auth truth (useAuth hook)
- No hydration mismatches between server and client
- Proper loading states prevent flashing
- Better error handling and debugging
