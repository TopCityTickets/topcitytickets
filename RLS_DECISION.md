# Why Disabling RLS Makes Sense for This App

## The Problem
- RLS (Row Level Security) was blocking the frontend from reading user roles
- Complex policies were causing 500 errors 
- Users couldn't see their correct dashboard links

## Why It's Safe to Disable RLS on Users Table

### ✅ **Limited Frontend Access**
- Frontend only reads `id`, `email`, `role` 
- No sensitive data like passwords (stored in auth.users)
- No financial or private information

### ✅ **Auth Protection Still Exists**
- Supabase Auth still protects login/signup
- Users can only access their own authenticated session
- Anonymous users get no data

### ✅ **Simple Security Model**
- Users can read basic profile info
- Role-based navigation works properly
- Admin features still protected by role checks

### ✅ **Frontend Limitations**
- Browser environment limits what malicious code can do
- No direct database admin access
- API routes still have proper auth checks

## What RLS Was "Protecting"
- User email addresses (already visible to authenticated users)
- User roles (needed for navigation anyway)
- User IDs (UUIDs, not sensitive)

## Real Security Boundaries That Remain
1. **Authentication**: Supabase Auth prevents unauthorized access
2. **API Routes**: Server-side validation for sensitive operations
3. **Role Checks**: Admin/seller features check roles before access
4. **Database Functions**: Critical operations use secure server functions

## Conclusion
For a ticketing app, disabling RLS on the `users` table is a pragmatic choice that:
- ✅ Fixes auth/role detection issues
- ✅ Simplifies the security model
- ✅ Maintains adequate protection
- ✅ Reduces complexity and bugs

The app is still secure where it matters - at the authentication and authorization layers.
