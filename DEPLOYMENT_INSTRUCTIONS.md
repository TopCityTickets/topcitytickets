# TopCityTickets Schema Update - Deployment Instructions

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- Added `first_name` and `last_name` columns to the `public.users` table
- Updated constraints and foreign keys
- Created improved trigger to auto-create public.users entries from auth.users
- Updated manual_signup function to handle first_name and last_name
- Simplified error handling to reduce complexity

### 2. Frontend Updates
- Updated `auth-form.tsx` to include separate first and last name fields
- Updated `signup/page.tsx` to use the new field structure
- Updated `login/page.tsx` to handle user metadata properly
- Updated all auth actions to use firstName and lastName fields

### 3. API Updates
- Simplified manual-signup API to reduce complexity
- Removed duplicate cleanup logic that was causing issues
- Updated error handling to be more user-friendly

### 4. Type Updates
- Updated database types to include first_name and last_name
- Updated auth types to support the new fields

## Required Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Run SQL Migration in Supabase
1. Open your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Run the contents of `supabase/migrations/002_update_user_schema.sql`
4. Verify the migration completed successfully

### Step 2: Deploy Frontend (Automatic)
The frontend changes have been committed and pushed to GitHub, which should trigger an automatic Vercel deployment.

### Step 3: Verify the Deployment
1. Check that the Vercel deployment completed successfully
2. Test the signup form to ensure first_name and last_name fields are visible and working
3. Test user registration with the new fields
4. Verify that existing users can still log in

## What's Different This Time

### Simplified Approach
- Removed complex duplicate user cleanup logic that was causing issues
- Simplified manual_signup function to focus on basic user creation
- Removed excessive error handling that was interfering with normal operation

### Clean Schema
- Properly structured database with first_name and last_name as required fields
- Consistent trigger behavior for creating public.users entries
- Clear separation between auth.users and public.users tables

### Better UX
- Separate first and last name fields in all forms
- Clear error messages for missing required fields
- Proper validation on both frontend and backend

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] SQL migration runs successfully in Supabase
- [ ] Signup form shows first_name and last_name fields
- [ ] New user registration works end-to-end
- [ ] Existing users can still log in
- [ ] User data is properly stored in both auth.users and public.users
- [ ] No 500 errors or "no rows returned" errors
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, you can:
1. Revert the GitHub commit: `git revert c2707b4`
2. Push the revert to trigger a new deployment
3. Manually clean up any database changes if needed

The database migration is designed to be safe and non-destructive, adding columns without removing existing data.
